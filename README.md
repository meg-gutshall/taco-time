# TacoTime

Spun up an app to commemorate the end of my 100 Days of Code challenge. Hope you like it!

## Installation & Setup

Fork the [taco-time repo](https://github.com/meg-gutshall/taco-time) and clone it down to your computer. In the terminal, `cd` to the taco-time root folder. Run `bundle install` to load the required Ruby gems and dependencies. Then type in `rake db:migrate` to create a new database from the migration tables stored under `db/migrate`.

## Usage

To deploy the TacoTime web app locally, type `shotgun` into your terminal and open your browser to `localhost:9393`. From there, you'll be able to navigate and interact with the app as if it were live. Don't forget to return to your terminal and type `Ctrl + C` to stop your session when you're done!
